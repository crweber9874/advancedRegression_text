<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Course Description<a href="syllabus.html#course-description" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to advanced techniques in regression, statistical computation, and techniques in scientific reproducibility and transparency. Students in this course should be very familiar with linear regression, as well as the Gauss-Markov assumptions underlying the classical linear model (i.e., POL 682). In this course, we will consider a variety of regression techniques for categorical and limited data. It is essential to remain up-to-date on the readings, as well as apply the reviewed methods to existing data.</p>
<p>The course will progress through several related sections. The first part will focus on several theoretical factors pertaining to statistical inference. We will start by considering two fundamental approaches underlying inference, the likelihood principle and Bayes’ rule. We will also re-consider the linear model, the Gauss-Markov assumptions, and we will review several concepts and statistical distributions. In this section we will also consider the practical trade off researchers encounter pertaining to efficiency and bias.</p>
<p>In the second section, we will move to discrete dependent and limited variables. In practice, it is quite rare to encounter dependent variables that are continuous and normally distributed. In circumstances with binary, ordinal, and other multicategory dependent variables, the Gauss-Markov assumptions will be violated, thus rendering OLS an inappropriate choice. At this juncture, we will use both maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods to estimate logit, probit, multinomial logit/probit, and ordinal logit/probit models.</p>
<p>Political scientists often encounter datasets that involve event counts (e.g., war casualties, number of conflict events, elections won by a candidate). These variables rarely follow a normal distribution; instead, they are heavily skewed. After the logit/probit weeks, we’ll consider several type of count-oriented regression models, including the Poisson, Negative Binomial, and “Hurdle” models. We will then transition to censored and sample selection models.</p>
<p>In the final section, we will consider a variety of topics that extend the models from the previous weeks. For instance, “endogeneity” is a common problem to arise in applied settings – an independent variable is correlated with the error term. We’ll look this problem in several ways, followed with several common solutions. We will examine two-stage least squares, three-stage least squares, and matching methods.Finally, we will examine hierarchical models.</p>
<p>Three major points need to be emphasized. First, many of the statistical methods build on models discussed in previous weeks. It is essential to keep up-to-date on readings, and if there is something that confuses you, please see me as soon as possible. Second, I find that the best way to learn these techniques is to implement them. I strongly recommend you find a dataset and work with this dataset throughout the semester. Even if your analysis is not always substantively interesting, at the very least, you will have the code for future use. Third, I strongly encourage you to give yourself sufficient time to complete the course requirements. One of the worst ways to learn statistics is through cramming and completing assignments at the very last minute. As you likely know, I am flexible with due dates and generally accept late assignments. Don’t take advantage of this policy! Handing things in late and consistently placing other obligations before this class has the potential to adversely impact what you learn.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical Software</strong></p>
<p>There are many statistical software packages available, all of which will perform the functions explored in this class. We will be relying on <em>R</em>, a free statistical program available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. R may be downloaded from the CRAN website (<a href="http://www.r-project.org" class="uri">http://www.r-project.org</a>). The CRAN site also includes a variety of user’s manuals, which I suggest you consult early in the semester (if you are unfamiliar with the R language).</p>
<p>We will explore a variety of Rfunctions throughout the semester. I will assume that you know the “basics,” such as opening a dataset, accessing variables, and creating new variables. I will also assume that you can run and estimate simple linear regression models, manipulate/recode data, and access saved objects.</p>
<p>We will also rely heavily on the <strong><em>Stan</em></strong> language for Bayesian models. Stan can be run on a variety of platforms; I would recommend using R. Please follow the instructions on this page:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started" class="uri"><em>https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started</em></a></p>
<p>Also, download and start following the Stan User’s Manual:</p>
<p><a href="http://mc-stan.org/documentation/" class="uri"><em>http://mc-stan.org/documentation/</em></a></p>
<p>I strongly recommend you install Stan in the first week of the semester. Occasionally, problems arise. These should be addressed early in the semester.</p>
<p>There is a really easy-to-use package in R called brms. We’ll use it throughout the term – it follows the structure of a <em>lm</em> call, but compiles and runs a stan regression model.</p>
<p><em>Open Science</em></p>
<p>This class strives to advance an open science framework, a shift in the basic and social sciences to make research, data, code, and publications open and accessible. In this class, we will discuss scientific techniques that promote collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility. This means we will generally rely on free tools – like R – public repositories and develop research protocols that are transparent and well documented. In practice, this means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We will regularly use open source software, like R.</p></li>
<li><p>We will develop open source code, by posting code on Github.</p></li>
<li><p>We will generate modular computer code.</p></li>
<li><p>We will generate code that produces reproducible examples.</p></li>
<li><p>We will generate clear clear documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to a variety of packages in R, we will rely on one built for this class (and very much, in production). It is called <strong>advancedRegression</strong>. You will periodically need to re-install package, as we’ll make updates through the semester.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong>. I tend to find that the most useful way to learn statistics is to practice statistics. I suspect this class will be far easier if you take the time (i.e., a few hours every week) to implement the procedures we discuss in class. I will make most of my code for this class available through github. We’ll spend some time on basic github operations in this cousre, so there is no need to set up anything in advance (simply be sure you have a github acct.)</p>
<p><strong>Github</strong> is a tool for version control and collaboration. You should create agithub user account during the first week, in addition to acquainting yourself with the service. Please also read some of the online tutorials regarding github and how to set it up with Rstudio orR. If you use an email other than your University of Arizona email, please let me know.</p>

<p>We will collaborate, but each person will play a unique role interpreting the results, which will form the basis for your grade. The goal for us, the challenge: <strong>Create statistically informed set of predictions, effectively visualize these predictions, and finally, put the report on a public website.</strong></p>
<p>How will we do this? First, start by familiarizing yourself with:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shiny</strong>. Shiny is an open-source R package. It allows one to build interactive visualizations. This can be really important in academic work, as well as data science applications more generally. This book is a good resource, <a href="#id_0" class="uri">https://mastering-shiny.org/</a>. And the documentation on the shiny website is also quite helpful, with many example <a href="#id_0" class="uri">https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Github.</strong> Code for the project should be pushed to the class repo.</p>
<p><strong>crweber9874/advanced_regression</strong></p>
<p><strong>Data sources.</strong> It is imperative that you research how others have generated election predictions, and where to find data. Should one use historical data, economic data, polling data, lots of polling data, and so forth? The project will entail a considerable amount of work, so it’s important to regularly work on the project, rather than procrastinating until shortly before the due date.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Protocol for Electoral Forecasting Project</strong></p>
<p>Please adhere to the following due dates.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>August 27, 2024: Create two research groups.</p></li>
<li><p>September 10, 2024: Generate model ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>October 1, 2024: Submit cleaned data, code, and documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>October 22: Submit predictions and brief report.</p></li>
<li><p>October 29: Build shiny application</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You must also complete a final project. This should include an analysis using methods from this class – i.e., the regression techniques from this class. The final paper should be between 10-15 pages in length. It is up to you to locate a dataset for both papers! I recommend exploring data options early in the semester, by searching for data on the ICPSR, Dataverse, or other data repositories. Alternatively, you are welcome to use data you have collected. You are free to choose the topic, but you must be able to provide me with the data used in your report. Again, your code should be shared on GitHub. If you or your advisor has proprietary data which I cannot access, you should not use this. I must be able to verify that you did all the necessary calculations honestly and accurately, which requires me being able to access any data you use. Also, if you rely on your own data, you must adhere to the University of Arizona’s Institutional Review Board requirements.</p>
<p>The paper should include all the elements of a research paper. That said, my primary interest rests in your analyses. I ask that you be quite thorough when presenting the results. It is not sufficient to just run a regression and present the point estimates. Your paper should include detailed interpretation, robustness checks, and post-estimation clarification (which often come in the form of graphics). It should be a high quality paper; if you would not be comfortable presenting it at a conference, you should not feel comfortable handing it in for a grade. <em>Do not just cut and paste R output. Tables and figures should be presented in a professional manner. I will deduct points for cut-and-pasted output from R.</em></p>
<p>Your statistical models should be theoretically informed. I do not require a full-fledged introduction/literature review, though you should spend a page or two briefly describing the relevant literature. It is essential to include the formal hypotheses you will test, which should relate to this one/two page review. I will need to verify that your empirical tests match your expectations. Please follow American Psychological Association (APA) style or American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) style. The references should appear at the end of your manuscript. Please do not place the references in footnotes.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend you meeting with me periodically throughout the semester to discuss these projects.</p>
<p>There will be a midterm exam (25%) and a final exam (30%). The final will be cumulative, and will cover all material from the semester. The midterm and final should be completed in-class. You may use your notes and the course materials to complete the both exams. The exam must be completed independently.</p>
